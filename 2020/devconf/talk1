# Everything you always wanted to know about kubectl & oc but were afraid to ask

## Description

This session is intended for all interested in what kubectl & oc is and what it does.
Whether you are fresh to Kubernetes/OpenShift or an old-timer you are more than welcome.
During this presentation Maciej who is overlooking CLI efforts both in Kubernetes
and OpenShift will discuss accomplishments of the past twelve months and will
cover the future of the tool. Additionally, Maciej is hoping to answer as
many questions as possible and turn this session into interactive discussion.

Topics to be covered include:

1. Splitting kubectl and oc to separate repositories.
2. Plugins - its development and management.
3. Resource configuration with Kustomize.
4. Dynamic commands, etc.
