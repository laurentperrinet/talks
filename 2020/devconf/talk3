# Can we make Python faster - Multiple Interpreters in the Stdlib

## Description

Pythonistas are well aware when dealing with computation intensive operation the
threading module is of not much help because of the dreaded Global Interpreter
Lock. The alternative is to use multiprocessing which runs all the operations in
a separate process, unfortunately the down side of that approach is communication.
What if there is middle ground, something that provides the separation like in
the multiprocessing, but still allows data sharing similarly to how threading does.
This is were PEP 554 introduced by Eric Snow comes in to play. It describes a
new provisional module called interpreters which will allow sharing data between
interpreters.
During this presentation Maciej will describe basic ideas presented in this enhancement
and the consequences of implementing them.

Topics to be covered include:

1. Threading vs multiprocessing vs GIL.
2. How to deal with concurrency.
3. How to share data.
4. Current progress and future.
